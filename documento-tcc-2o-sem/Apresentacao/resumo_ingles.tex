 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
The social network Twitter is used to exchange instant messages, in which a huge amount of data is generated from its members interactions. A large volume of data is made available by the social network allowing its analysis in order to generate useful knowledge. This paper presents the study and implementation of data mining techniques for analysis and mining of the data collected on April 17, 2016, the date of the vote, in the Brazilian Congress, about the continuation of the impeachment process of President Dilma Rousseff, and takes advantage of features and libraries that the Python programming language has for data extraction and presentation of these data in graphics, thus allowing the visualization and interpretation of the obtained results.
